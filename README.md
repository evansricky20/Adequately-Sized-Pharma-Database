# Adequately-Sized-Pharma-Database
This was a class project where I was tasked to create a database using MySQL for a healthcare-related business. The chosen business was a pharmacy, and the database is to be used by the pharmacy for finding customers, doctors, employees, and other data relating to the pharmacy. 

This was a group project, team contributions are as follows:
  Vu: Constructed EER diagram, wrote problem statement, and abstract, and did report formatting.
  Richard (Me): Constructed ER diagram, created user interface using HTML and CSS, implemented PHP in conjunction with MySQL for SQL logic, and wrote chapters 3 and 4 in the report. 
  Orlando: Wrote introduction, target use, requirements, and conclusion for the report.
  James: Mapped EER to relational schema, and wrote Chapter 2 in the report.

This interface was implemented using XAMPP and phpMyAdmin. It will be used through local host. The PHP files connect using port 3307.
